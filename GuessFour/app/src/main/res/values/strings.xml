		GuessFour is a logic game. Try to guess the secret
		code that has been chosen. The code contains four colored pegs.
		The pegs may be blue, green, orange, purple, red, or yellow.\n\n
		Guess the color and order of the pegs in the code.
		After each guess you get feedback. Each white feedback peg indicates one of
		your
		pegs is the right color, but is in the wrong position. Each black feedback
		peg
		indicates one of your pegs is the right color
		<b>and</b>
		in the right
		position. You are not told which of your pegs generate the feedback pegs.\n\n
		You have 12 guesses to crack the code.\n\n
		The easy version of the game has a code with 3 pegs and only uses 4 colors of pegs.\n\n
		The hard version of the game has a code with 5 pegs and 8 colors of pegs. (pink and teal)\n\n
